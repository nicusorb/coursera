<center>Frequently Asked Questions</center>

<p>
<b>How do I read in the data?</b>
We recommend using the <tt>readInt()</tt> and <tt>readString()</tt> methods
from <a href = "http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/In.java.html">In.java</a>.

<p>
<b>How efficient should my program be?
</b>
You should be able to handle all of the test input files provided (say, in
less than a minute).
Do not worry about over-optimizing your program because the data sets
that arise in real applications are tiny.

<p>
<b>What should I return if there is more than one certificate of elimination?
</b>
Return any such subset.

<p>
<b>Must I output the teams in the same order as in the input file (as does the reference solution)?</b>
</b>
No, any order is fine.

<p>
<b>Should <tt>certificateOfElimination()</tt> work even if 
<tt>isEliminated()</tt> has not been called by the client first?
</b>
Absolutely. It is bad design (and a violation of the API)
for the success of calling one method to depend
on the client previously calling another method.

<p>
<b>How do I compute the mincut?
</b>
The <tt>inCut()</tt> method in
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/64maxflow/FordFulkerson.java.html">
FordFulkerson.java</a> takes a vertex as an argument and returns true if
that vertex is on the <em>s</em>-side of the mincut.

<p>
<b>How do I specify an infinite capacity for an edge?
</b>
Use <tt>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</tt>.

<p>
<b>What would cause <tt>FordFulkerson.java</tt> to throw a runtime exception
with the message
<tt>"Edge does not satisfy capacity constraints: ..."</tt>?
</b>
Did you create an edge with negative capacity?


<p><b>My program runs much faster in practice than my theoretical analysis
guarantees. Should I be concerned?</b>
No, there are a number of reasons why your program will perform better than
your worst-case guarantee.

<ul>

<p><li>
If a team is eliminated for a trivial reason, your code may run much faster
because it avoids computing a maxflow.

<p><li>
If there are no games between most pairs of teams, then the flow network you
construct may have many fewer edges than in the worst case.

<p><li>
The flow networks that arise in the baseball elimination problem have special
structure, e.g., they are bipartite and the edge capacities are small integers.
As a result, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm performs significantly faster
than its worst-case guarantee of <em>V</em> <em>E</em><sup>2</sup>.


</ul>

<!--
For the input files <tt>teams[xx]-dense.txt</tt>, our reference solution
has a running time of about N^4.5 to determine <em>all</em> teams
that are mathematically eliminated.

<STRONG>Input and testing.</STRONG>

The directory
<a href = "http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/baseball">baseball</a>
contains some sample input files.
For convenience, <a href = "http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/baseball-testing.zip">baseball-testing.zip</a>
contains all of these files bundled together.

<p>
<b>Testing.</b>
&nbsp;
For reference, the teams below are mathematically eliminated for <em>nontrivial</em> reasons.
By nontrivial, we mean that the certificate of elimination requires two or more teams. If a team is trivially eliminated, it does not appear in the list below.

To verify that you are returning a valid certificate of elimination <em>R</em>, compute
<em>a</em>(<em>R</em>) = (<em>w</em>(<em>R</em>) + <em>g</em>(<em>R</em>)) / |<em>R</em>|,
where <em>w</em>(<em>R</em>) is the total number of wins of teams in <em>R</em>,
<em>g</em>(<em>R</em>) is the total number of remaining games
between teams in <em>R</em>, and |<em>R</em>| is the number
of teams in <em>R</em>. Check that <em>a</em>(<em>R</em>) is greater than the maximum number of games
the eliminated team can win

<center>Possible Progress Steps</center>
</table>

<P>These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress. You do not have to follow these steps. 

<ul>

<!--
<p><li> Download the zip file
<a href = "http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/baseball-testing.zip">baseball-testing.zip</a>.
It contains a number of sample input files.
-->

<p><li>
Write code to read in the input file and store the data.

<p><li>
Draw by hand the <tt>FlowNetwork</tt> graph that you want to construct
for a few small examples.
Write the code to construct the <tt>FlowNetwork</tt>, print it out using
the <tt>toString()</tt> method, and and make sure that it matches your
intent.
Do not continue until you have thoroughly tested this stage.


<p><li>
Compute the maxflow and mincut using the <tt>FordFulkerson</tt> data type.
You can access the value of the flow with the <tt>value()</tt> method;
you can identify which vertices are on the source side of the mincut
with the <tt>inCut()</tt> method.

<p><li> The <tt>BaseballElimination</tt> API contains the public methods
that you will implement. For modularity, you will want to add some
private helper methods of your own.

</ul>
 
<p>
Your program shouldn't be too long&mdash;ours is less than 200 lines.
If things get complicated, take a step back and re-think your approach.
